# Mission-to-Mars
The purpose of this module was to begin learning how to webscrape, specfically with html and css. In this module, we created a webpage that scraped data from other sites to compile data about Mars. In accomplishing this, we learned the following items:
- familiarity with html elements such as class, id and attributes
- using BeautifulSoup and Splinter to automate a browser and perform a web scrape
- creating a MongoDB database to store data from a web scrape
- creating web app with Flask to display data from a web scrape
- creating an html/css portfolio to showcase projects
- using Bootstrap components to customize a portfolio
